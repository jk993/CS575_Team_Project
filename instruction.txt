HW: Group Project

You will implement and deploy a small, but distributed system demonstrating some of the software architecture and design concepts covered in the class.

This is not expected to be a large software development effort, but what you build should embrace software design and/or architecture concepts that we covered in class, applying design and architectural patterns.

Instructions:
- All of your project code should be available on a publicly available repo such as github or bitbucket.  You can create a free account if you don't already have one.  You can use something other then GitHub, but it must be publicly available.  I should be able to pull the code, and your distribution must have a build/make process that is easy to follow.

- You are required to do a screen capture to show a demo of your solution.  The video should be available online over the Internet.  If you don't have a place to store your video you can use YouTube, its free.  The demo should not be longer then 5 min in length and should have audio describing what you are doing as you demo your solution.

- You must submit a single file to blackboard, as a group that includes your name and links to the video and source code repository. You can also put any additional "readme" information that I will need to pull your code, build it, and test it.  The single file should also have a few views (between one and four) describing the architecture of your solution and a short description explaining the views that you provide.

Due dates:
- Oct 24th: Write a paragraph to brief your idea of the project:
> What will be the main functions?
> Which distributed infrastructure will be used?
> Which programming languages will be used?
> Which development environment will be used?
> How to support maintainability?

- Oct 31th: An updated document elaborating the project plan, in addition to the updated info from the previous submission, please also add:
> Where do you host the repository?
> How to manage your the issue tracking system?
> Which testing framework do you plan to use?
> The role of each member in a team 10
> When do you plan to finish which functions by whom?

- Nov 21th: Midterm Demo and Project Report

- Dec 8th: Final project due.
